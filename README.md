# Pokemon App

https://danielsiklodi-pokepedia.netlify.app

An app that pulls information about all Pokemon from an API and displays it on screen. The number of Pokemon fetched from the api is 50,
but the user can choose to load more with a button. It's also possible to filter through the Pokemon by using the search bar at the top
of the screen.

The user can press on any of the Pokemon to go to another page that has more information about that specific Pokemon, such as a short
description, base stats, evolutions (which the user can click on to go to that pokemon's page), and pokemon tcg cards that contain that
specific pokemon.

APIs used: https://pokeapi.co/ and https://pokemontcg.io/

Using HTML, CSS, and React.JS
